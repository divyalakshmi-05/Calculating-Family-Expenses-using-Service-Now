    FamilyExpenses.addQuery('u_date', current.u_date);  
    FamilyExpenses.query();  

    if (FamilyExpenses.next()) {  
        FamilyExpenses.u_amount += current.u_expense;  
        FamilyExpenses.u_expense_details += ">" + current.u_comments + ": Rs." + current.u_expense + "/-";  
        FamilyExpenses.update();  
    } else {  
        var NewFamilyExpenses = new GlideRecord('u_family_expenses');  
        NewFamilyExpenses.u_date = current.u_date;  
        NewFamilyExpenses.u_amount = current.u_expense;  
        NewFamilyExpenses.u_expense_details = ">" + current.u_comments + ": Rs." + current.u_expense + "/-";  
        NewFamilyExpenses.insert();
